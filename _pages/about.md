Introduction:
------
I am a Neuroscience MSc from Turkey, currently continuing my endeavors at JLU Gie√üen in Germany, as a research associate. 

Here you can find information about me, my academic studies, and my teaching. On the sidebar you can find my socials and academic links. Using the navigation bar, you can easily find my CV, recent posts, publications, and teaching material.

Will add more content soon.
