Hi! I'm Aysu. I am an aspiring scientist from Turkey, specializing in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Currently, I am a doctoral researcher at JLU Gie√üen in Germany. My interests are visual perception, memory, and decision making - especially how they are affected by reward and punishment. During my Master's, I delved into the task-driven modulation of scene perception, focusing on the scene selective regions in the brain. I love studying the brain and the human behavior that help us understand the complicated ways the brain works, mainly using fMRI methods and accompanying behavioral experiments.

On this website you can find information about me and my academic endeavors. On the sidebar you can find my socials and academic links. Using the navigation bar, you can easily access my CV, recent posts, publications, and teaching material.

Will add more content soon.
